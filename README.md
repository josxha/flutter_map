## Demonstration

Setting up an interactive and compliant[^1] map is simpler than making your lunch-time coffee! It can be accomplished in just under 30 lines and a minute or two to install.

This code snippet demonstrates **everything** you need for a simple map (in just over 20 lines!), but of course, FM is capable of much more than just this, and you could find yourself lost in the many options available and possibilities opened!

<pre class="language-dart" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-dart">import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-2">FlutterMap</a>(
    <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-3">options</a>: MapOptions(
      center: LatLng(51.509364, -0.128928),
      zoom: 9.2,
    ),
    nonRotatedChildren: [
      <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-4">RichAttributionWidget</a>(
        attributions: [
          TextSourceAttribution(
            'OpenStreetMap contributors',
            onTap: () => <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-5">launchUrl</a>(Uri.parse('https://openstreetmap.org/copyright')),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
    <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-6">children</a>: [
      TileLayer(
        <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-7">urlTemplate</a>: 'https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
        userAgentPackageName: 'com.example.app',
      ),
    ],
  );
}

<summary>How does flutter_map compare to other mapping libraries?</summary>

This usually refers to libraries such as 'mapbox\_gl' and 'google\_maps\_flutter'. In most ways, it is better, in some it is worse.

flutter\_map wins on:

* Less vendor lock-in (and potentially reduced costs)\
  You're not locked into a particular tile server with us - choose from hundreds of options, or build your own!
* Customizability & extensibility\
  Add all sorts of layers to display custom widgets and data on top of your map, and choose from flutter\_map's many community maintained plugins to add even more functionality!
* Ease of use/setup\
  We don't require any API keys or platform specific setup (other than enabling the Internet permission!), so you can get started quicker, and make changes without fear of breaking your release application.
* Support quality and frequency\
  Most questions are answered and resolved within 12-24 hours, thanks to our dedicated maintainers and community.&#x20;

However, alternatives may win on:

* Performance\*\
  flutter\_map's performance is very adequate for the vast majority of applications, and many big businesses use FM to provide maps in their Flutter app.\
  However, if you're using high-thousands of `Markers` or `Polygons` and such like, alternatives may win, purely because they use platform views and GL, and so can do calculations outside of Dart.
* ... and that's pretty much it ðŸ˜‰
